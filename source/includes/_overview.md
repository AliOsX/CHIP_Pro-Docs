# C.H.I.P. Pro Overview

![C.H.I.P. Pro](images/CHIPPro.jpg)

At Next Thing Co., we’ve been working to integrate computer hardware in products for years. C.H.I.P. Pro is a product development platform built around our GR8 system-in-package: a 1GHz Allwinner R8 ARM Cortex-A8 processor,  Mali-400 GPU, and 256MB of Nanya DDR3 DRAM combine in a 14mm x 14mm FBGA package. 

Joining the GR8 on the C.H.I.P. Pro are 512MB of built-in high-speed NAND flash storage pre-flashed with our GadgetOS, and an AXP209 power management unit supporting either USB or battery power.

C.H.I.P. Pro offers all the popular interfaces you’d expect. With 2 UARTs, a TWI, a CMOS camera interface sensor, SPI and I2S buses, 2 PWM channels, a USB 2.0 OTG, and a USB 2.0 Host, C.H.I.P. Pro is packed full of I/O expandability.

An FCC/CE/IC certified Realtek 8723BS combination module provides WiFi B/G/N and Bluetooth 4.0 Low-Energy and we’ve added a uFL antenna connector in case you’d like to boost the transmit and receive range.

C.H.I.P. Pro is rated to operate between 2.9V-6V in temperatures ranging between -25 and 85 degrees Celsius, and we can’t wait to see how you’ll implement it in your next product.
