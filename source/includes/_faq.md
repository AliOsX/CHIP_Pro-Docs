## C.H.I.P. Pro
### How much does the C.H.I.P. Pro cost?
C.H.I.P. Pro costs $16.

### Does the C.H.I.P. Pro cost change if I order more than one?
No. Each C.H.I.P. Pro is $16 no matter how many you order.

### Why does the C.H.I.P. Pro cost more than C.H.I.P.?
Everything about C.H.I.P. Pro is optimized to be put into consumer products. C.H.I.P. Pro is 45mm x 30mm x 5.2mm, that's 76% smaller than C.H.I.P.. C.H.I.P. Pro is optimized to be both breadboardable and SMT placeable.

In the process of making C.H.I.P., we put a ton of work into our factory flashing and testing. C.H.I.P. Pro includes the flashing of a customers’ customized operating system based on GadgetOS in our factory, so it arrives at theirs tested and ready for production.

### Is the C.H.I.P. Pro open source?
Yes, you can see our design files in our git repository.

### Does C.H.I.P. Pro replace C.H.I.P.?
Nope! We made C.H.I.P. Pro to enable our C.H.I.P.ster community to scale their C.H.I.P. projects into mass production.


### Where can I buy the C.H.I.P. Pro?
Currently we’re offering the C.H.I.P. Pro Evaluation Kit for $49 in our web store. They’re estimated to ship by the end of the year. C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in any quantity in Q1 of 2017.

###  How many C.H.I.P. Pro can I order?
1 to 1 million or more! They’ll be available in any quantity Q1 of 2017. We’d recommend starting with the C.H.I.P. Pro Evaluation Kit. For bulk orders, contact sales@nextthing.co.
	
 When does the C.H.I.P. Pro start shipping?
C.H.I.P. Pro Evaluation kits are estimated to ship by the end of 2016. C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in any quantity Q1 of 2017.

###  What is the lead time on a C.H.I.P. Pro order?
Once made available in Q1 of 2017, small orders (1-20) will ship immediately. For large orders taking advantage of our factory flashing offering, there will be a lead time of 60 days.

### Does C.H.I.P. Pro have USB?
Yes, C.H.I.P. Pro has a micro USB 2.0 OTG controller. You can breakout 2 fullsize USB ports on a PCB.

###  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be hardware and software compatible with GR8?
Yes! Because the GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processer, your software is 100% compatible. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production.

### Who are some of the companies using GR8 in their products?
Oh man. We cannot wait to tell you. Stay tuned. Stay very very tuned.

## GR8

 What are the GR8’s dimensions?
14mm x 14mm, 0.8mm pitch

### How much does GR8 cost?
GR8 costs $6.00 and comes with the AXP-209 power management chip, for which it is optimized.

### What is the GR8 package?
FBGA 252 balls

### If I order multiple GR8s, do I need multiple GR8 Modules?
Depends on your project. We offer GR8 separately so you can layout your PCB in anyway you want. The best way to get started using GR8 is the C.H.I.P. Pro Evaluation Kit. It will get you up and running with GR8 in minutes.

### What countries will you ship GR8 to?
We only ship to XXXX countries through our web store currently. We’re talking with distributors currently to offer to more countries.

### I have a prototype of my product, is GR8 right for me?
Depends! For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best way to work with  GR8. We’ve already sourced 127 components for you and include all the working drivers. If you’ve tried C.H.I.P. Pro but are looking for a differently layout, the GR8 is a great option.

### What Operating Systems run on GR8?
GadgetOS

### Is GR8 available from any distributors?

### I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Yeah! We want to talk to you. Contact us at sales@nextthing.co.

### Does GR8 have a built-in antenna?

### Is GR8 Open Hardware?
Yes? We tell you exactly whats in it? No? We dont’ show how the two wafers combine?

### Does GR8 come pre-flashed with an operating system?
GR8 doesn’t come with an operating system pre-flashed, but once you get GR8

### Do you offer custom flashing solutions?
For C.H.I.P. Pro yes! For GR8, no, but you still have access to GadgetOS and our cloud build tools to provide a real simple flashing solution for your prototypes.

### How much power does GR8 consume?


### Does GR8 have FCC certification?
? does it need it? I dont think it does. The wifi and ble stuff does. And C.H.I.P. Pro will have those certifciations.

### How do you power GR8?

 Why is there less memory than C.H.I.P.?
C.H.I.P. Pro is optimized for products. When you’re not needing to drive an HD display, your RAM is much more efficient. This is one of the decisions we’ve made that allows us to sell C.H.I.P. Pro at the price we’re able. If you’re curious how your code will run on C.H.I.P. Pro, try the C.H.I.P. Pro Evaluation Kit. We think you’ll be surprised.
