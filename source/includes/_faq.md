## Are there quantity discounts?
No. Each C.H.I.P. Pro is $16 no matter how many you order.

## Why does the C.H.I.P. Pro cost more than C.H.I.P.?
Everything about C.H.I.P. Pro is optimized to be put into consumer products. C.H.I.P. Pro is 45mm x 30mm x 5.2mm, that's 76% smaller than C.H.I.P.. It's also designed to be both breadboardable and SMT placeable.

In the process of making C.H.I.P., we put a ton of work into our factory flashing and testing. C.H.I.P. Pro includes the flashing of a customers’ customized operating system based on GadgetOS in our factory, so it arrives at theirs tested and ready for production.

## Is the C.H.I.P. Pro open source?
Yes, you can see our design files in our [git repository](https://github.com/NextThingCo).

## Does C.H.I.P. Pro replace C.H.I.P.?
Nope! We made C.H.I.P. Pro to enable our C.H.I.P.ster community to scale their C.H.I.P. projects into mass production.

## Where can I buy the C.H.I.P. Pro?
Currently we’re offering the C.H.I.P. Pro Alpha Kit for $49 in our web store with an estimated shipping by the end of this year. C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in Q1 of 2017.

##  How many may I order?
You may order 1 to 1 million or more! For bulk orders, contact [sales@nextthing.co](sales@nextthing.co).
	
## When will C.H.I.P. Pro ship?
C.H.I.P. Pro Alpha Kits is shipping in late Q4 of 2016 and C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in any quantity starting Q1 of 2017.

##  What is the lead time on a C.H.I.P. Pro order?
Once available in Q1 of 2017, small orders (1-20) will ship immediately. For large orders taking advantage of our factory flashing offering, there will be a lead time of 60 days.

##  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be hardware and software compatible with GR8?
Yes! GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production.

# GR8 FAQ

## What are the GR8’s dimensions?
14mm x 14mm, 0.8mm pitch.

## What is the GR8 package?
252 ball FBGA package.

## I have a prototype of my product, is GR8 right for me?
Depends! For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best way to work with GR8. We’ve already sourced 127 components for you and include all the working drivers. If you’ve tried C.H.I.P. Pro but are looking for a differently layout, then GR8 is a great option.

## What Operating Systems run on GR8?
GadgetOS is an optimised version of Linux for GR8 and CHIP Pro.

## I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Sure! We want to talk to you. Contact us at sales@nextthing.co.

## Do you offer custom flashing solutions?
For C.H.I.P. Pro yes! For GR8, no, but you still have access to GadgetOS and our cloud build tools to provide a real simple flashing solution for your prototypes.

## Why is there less memory than C.H.I.P.?
C.H.I.P. Pro is optimized for products. When you don't need to drive an HD display, your RAM is much more efficient. This is one of the decisions we’ve made that allows us to sell C.H.I.P. Pro at the price we’re able. If you’re curious how your code will run on C.H.I.P. Pro, try the C.H.I.P. Pro Alpha Kit. We think you’ll be surprised.

## How can I order a LOT of C.H.I.P. Pro?
Please contact us directly at sales@nextthing.co.

## Who are some of the companies using GR8 in their products?
